<h1> Plant Watring System </h1>
<p>
    One of the most common problems that should be paid attention to while taking care of the
    plants is: the irrigation scheduling. Overwatering occurs when you water your plants too early or
    for a long period of time, which can cause crop damage and wasting water & money. On the
    other hand, underwatering happens when you notice that the soil became too dry for too long
    causing wilting of leaves which can affect the agricultural trade.

    We can solve this problem by using a soil moisture sensor. This sensor is usually used to detect
    moisture in the soil, so it’s ideal for scheduling an automatic irrigation system or for monitoring
    the moisture of the soil in which you have planted your plants. Which is an efficient way of using
    technology in improving farming by helping farmers save money and water considering that they
    can decide “when and how long” they need to water the plants to avoid overwatering and
    underwatering.
